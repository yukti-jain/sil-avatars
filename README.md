# Generate Culturally Appropriate Avatars
## Overview
Developed by Purdue University's M.S. in Business Analytics & Information Management students in collaboration with SIL International, this project aims to create culturally accurate avatars using generative AI to address biases in current models.

## Objective
To develop and implement a text-to-image generative model that accurately generates culturally appropriate avatars. This initiative seeks to counteract the prevailing biases in existing AI models, which predominantly feature Western imagery, by introducing a diverse array of cultural representations. Our goal is to create avatars that accurately reflect the characteristics of indigenous and other underrepresented communities, thereby fostering greater inclusivity in digital media. The model will serve various applications including education, healthcare, and public engagement, enabling these communities to see themselves represented more faithfully in digital content. This project not only aims to enhance technological equity but also supports broader efforts to respect and integrate diverse cultural identities in the development of AI technologies.
